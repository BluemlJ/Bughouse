# How to extract data
## Where to find data
I used the FICS Database to get games. You can download the data from [here](https://www.bughouse-db.org/)
or by running download_data.py.
Please save the data in the data folder.

## Which format should the data have
The data should have BPGN Format. (*.bpgn)

## The extraction script
The extraction script is written for the data from the FICS Database, so it whould only work with them.
Feel free to adapt the script for other sources. 
The extracted data will be saved as a csv file (Seperator ";", Encoding "utf-8").
For the complete FICS Database, the csv will have between 5 and 6 GB.
